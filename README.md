# üí± FX Deals Warehouse (FX-DWH)

A simple Java Gradle application that ingests **foreign exchange (FX) deals** from either:
- a **CSV file**, or  
- a **single-line deal input**

and stores them in a **PostgreSQL** database using **Docker Compose**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose**
- **Make**
- **Java 21+** and **Gradle** (only needed for local builds)

---

## üöÄ Build & Run

### 1. Build the Java project
```bash
make build
```
This runs Gradle‚Äôs installDist to build the application binaries into /app/build/install/app.

### 2. Build the Docker image
```bash
make docker
```
This creates a Docker image named fx-dwh using the built artifacts.

### 3. Start the full stack (Postgres + App)
```bash
make up
```
This runs both the Postgres database and the FX-DWH app containers.

---

## üß† Running the App with Data

You can pass data to the app either as a CSV file or a single deal line.
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Option 1: Using a CSV file
```bash
make run FILE=/app/sample-data/deals-sample.csv
```
This loads all deals from the CSV file and inserts them into the database.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Option 2: Using a single-line deal input
```bash
make run DEAL="D-1006,USD,EUR,2025-09-30T10:15:30Z,10000.50"
```
This inserts one deal directly (without needing a CSV).

---

## üß± Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS deals (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    deal_uid VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    from_currency CHAR(3) NOT NULL,
    to_currency CHAR(3) NOT NULL,
    deal_timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    amount NUMERIC(20,6) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    CONSTRAINT uq_deal_uid UNIQUE (deal_uid)
);
```

## üß∞ Common Make Commands

| Command             | Description                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `make build`        | Build Java project using Gradle |
| `make docker`       | Build Docker image              |
| `make up`           | Start app + database            |
| `make down`         | Stop all containers             |
| `make run FILE=...` | Run app with CSV                |
| `make run DEAL=...` | Run app with single deal        |
| `make test`         | Run unit tests                  |
| `make clean`        | Clean Gradle build artifacts    |

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Accessing the Database
You can connect to the Postgres container:
```bash
docker exec -it fx-dwh-db psql -U postgres -d fxdb
```

then run:
```sql
SELECT * FROM deals;
```
##üßπ Restarting Everything

```bash
make down
```
Stops and removes all containers, networks, and volumes.

---

## üß© Notes
- The app automatically waits until Postgres is ready before starting (via wait-for-it.sh).
- Both CSV and single-line inputs are supported.
- Logs are shown in the terminal when running with Docker Compose.
- two csv files are provided within the app directory. Therefore, you can modify them directly to add new lines of deal, you can find them in:
  ```bash
  app/sample-data/deals-sample.csv
  app/sample-data/deals-sample2.csv
  ```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Example End-to-End Run
```bash
make clean
make build
make docker
make up
make run FILE=/app/sample-data/deals-sample.csv
make run DEAL="D-2001,2025-10-04,USD/JPY,500000,149.32"
```
